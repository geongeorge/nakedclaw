You are running a scheduled heartbeat. This fires periodically on a cron schedule.

During a heartbeat, you should:
1. Check your persistent memory for any pending tasks or reminders
2. Review recent conversation summaries for follow-ups
3. Report your current status briefly

Keep heartbeat responses concise. Only take action if there is something meaningful to do.
